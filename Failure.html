<div>Now, onto the unfortunate life of Rishi Shriram Anand</div>
<h2>Conception</h2>
<div style="color: white;">&nbsp</div>
<div>The first failure of Rishi Anand's life is quite interesting. Some historians attribute it to his parents, but really, it was his own fault. I am of course talking about his conception. At the moment of Rishi's conception, dissapointment was felt around the nation, nay, the world. This was due to Rishi emanating the vibulations of failure. This moment set the precident for the life of Rishi Anand. Rishi, at this moment, realized that his life would be dissapointing. In some ways, I, Jishnu, feel sorrow for Rishi. However, his situation was a result of his own actions. </div>
