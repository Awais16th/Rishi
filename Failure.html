<h1>The Failures of Rishi Shriram Anand</h1>
<div>This site will document the failures of Rishi Shriram Anand, an individual who is simply unable to live a life of joy. Through this site, I hope readers will be able to gain insight into how to not live one's life. This site shall serve as a guide and a memoir, if you will, please use it with discretion and for educational purposes.</div>
<div style="color: white;">&nbsp</div>
<div>Now, onto the unfortunate life of Rishi Shriram Anand</div>
<h2>Conception</h2>
<div style="color: white;">&nbsp</div>
<div>The first failure of Rishi Anand's life is quite interesting. Some historians attribute it to his parents, but really, it was his own fault. I am of course talking about his conception. At the moment of Rishi's conception, dissapointment was felt around the nation, nay, the world. This was due to Rishi emanating the vibulations of failure. This moment set the precident for the life of Rishi Anand. Rishi, at this moment, realized that his life would be dissapointing. In some ways, I, Jishnu, feel sorrow for Rishi. However, his situation was a result of his own actions. </div>
<div style="color: white;">&nbsp</div>
<h2>Romantic Life</h2>
<div style="color: white;">&nbsp</div>
  <div>The romantic life of Rishi Shriram Anand is one of great peril. He frequently boasts a positive block ratio. On the contrary, he also boasts a negative block ratio. No one is truly sure what that means. Throughout his adolosense, Rishi, like many young children, experienced crushes and romantic interest females. Out of privacy, I will not be naming names but there are about 2. He is made fun of for many more than two which is quite interesting; it can be assumed it is done due to his nature of valuing his friends opinions. RIshi's romantic life has been wildly unsuccesful, but through those experiences, he has now instead chosen to focus upon himself and better himself. While this may be seen as good by you readers, he still gets 'No bitches', as modern slang would say.</div>
<div style="color: white;">&nbsp</div>
  <div>An important experience in his dating life was when Rishi had a crush on a girl who we shall refer to as W. W sadly did not feel the same way. This is a common experience in the life of many and it is one Rishi Anand has had to deal with many tims throughout his life.</div>
<div style="color: white;">&nbsp</div>
  <div>In all, up to the date of Tuesday January 4th, the dating life of Rishi Shriram Anand has been quite unsuccesful and simply pitiful to be looked at. Currently, he is still in his sigma arc and is working to hopefully one day recieve attention from maidens.</div>
